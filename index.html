        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Ciara Grayson, an aspiring software developer with hands-on experience in front-end programming and a passion for creating functional, user-friendly applications. I’ve developed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through coursework, projects, and my current training with Code the Dream, where I’ve explored key programming concepts like arrays, objects, methods, and version control using Git and GitHub.

            I enjoy problem-solving and have a particular interest in writing clean, efficient code to build dynamic web interfaces. Learning to work with IDEs and mastering tools like Git has been a rewarding challenge, and I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world projects.
            
            I’m committed to continuous growth as a developer and look forward to tackling new technologies and creating impactful solutions in the tech space.</p>
