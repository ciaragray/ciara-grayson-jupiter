## **About the Project**
Algorithms are a fundamental part of programming. In this assignment, you'll learn:
- What an algorithm is.
- Properties that define a good algorithm.
- How to approach problem-solving using algorithms.
- Implementation of a few example algorithms in JavaScript.

This project is designed to build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and enhance problem-solving skills.

## **Concepts Covered**
The key topics explored in this assignment include:
- Understanding **what is an algorithm**.
- Exploring the **properties of a good algorithm**, such as efficiency and clarity.
- Generating **ideas to solve problems** using algorithms.
- Practicing **JavaScript-based algorithms** to reinforce the concepts.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithms-week6.git
   cd algorithms-week6
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).

3. Run the JavaScript files to test the algorithms:
   ```bash
   node <filename>.js
   ```

4. Modify or extend the algorithms to practice further.

## **Prerequisites**
To work on this project, you’ll need:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
- Node.js installed on your system to run JavaScript files locally.
